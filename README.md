<h1>Multi-Attribute Decision Making - R</h1>
<hr>
<h2>A highly robust tool for decision analysts to make quick and effective function calls on pre-defined raw data matrices.</h2>
<p>Specific functionality that version 1.0.0 of the <code>madmr</code> Package includes: </p>
<ul> 
<li>Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution <strong>TOPSIS</strong></li>
<li>Multi-Attribute Utility Theory <strong>MAUT</strong></li>
    <ul> 
        <p> On scales including: </p>
        <li> Linear </li>
        <li> Exponential </li>
        <li> Logarithmic </li>
    </ul>
<li> Sensitivity Analysis including functionality to allow:
    <ul> 
        <li> Specific or <em>any number of attributes to be examined</em> in the sensitivity analysis </li>
        <li> Specific or exaustive <em>sensitivity searching</em> to determine all important weighting combinations for you </li>
        <li> Specific or <emany number of madmr methods</em> supported in the most up to date version of the package </li>
        <li> Optional user defined <em>step sizes</em> to tailor your desired fidelity </li>
        <li> Optional user defined <em>window sizes</em> to introduce regions of interest to allow pockets of constrained sensitivity to be examined </li>
        <li> Optional user defined <em>splitting of percetnages</em> as weights fluctuate accross the sensitivity, allowing a human interaction and bias to enter into the analysis</li>
        <li> Provision to as <em>little or as much detail desired</em>, allowing flexibility on analysis and results to your data</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
